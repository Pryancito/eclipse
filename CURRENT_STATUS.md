- ✅ **sys_read:** Real disk reads
- ✅ **sys_close:** Proper FD cleanup
- ✅ **sys_write:** FD integration, offset tracking (NEW in Phase 7)
- ⚠️ **sys_write (disk):** Data not persisted yet
- ⚠️ **lseek:** Not implemented yet

### Userland Services (75% Complete)
- ✅ All services have standardized structure
- ✅ Enum-based command handling
- ⚠️ Most still have stub implementations
- ⚠️ Need kernel integration

## ⚠️ What Needs Work

### High Priority
1. **Authentication** - Real user authentication in SecurityServer
2. **Filesystem Write Persistence** - Implement disk write operations  
3. **Testing** - Comprehensive end-to-end testing
4. **Service Implementation** - Replace stubs with real code

### Medium Priority
5. **Advanced File Ops** - lseek, stat, readdir
6. **Authorization** - Capability-based permissions
7. **Driver Writes** - ATA write operations
8. **DMA Support** - Faster I/O performance

### Low Priority
9. **Key Management** - Secure key storage for crypto
10. **Interrupt-Driven I/O** - Replace polling
11. **Advanced Features** - Various optimizations
