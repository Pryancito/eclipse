# hunter — Eclipse OS in-kernel security subsystem

`hunter` is a small in-kernel **security solution** for Eclipse OS that combines
an **LSM-style enforcement layer** (mandatory policy checks at well-defined
kernel hook points) with a **behavioural intrusion-detection system** (IDS).
The kernel calls into a handful of hooks; hunter consults its policy engine,
runs anomaly heuristics, and records every decision in a forensic event log
that userspace can read at `/proc/hunter`.

The crate lives at [`hunter/`](../hunter) and is `#![no_std]`. It has no hard
dependency on `kernel-hal`: the kernel injects a monotonic clock at boot via
`hunter::set_time_source`, keeping the crate low in the build graph and unit
testable on the host.

## Hooks

| Hook                       | Kernel call site                         | Domain          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `check_syscall`            | `linux-syscall` dispatch                 | seccomp + IDS   |
| `check_elf_binary`         | `sys_execve`                             | exec integrity  |
| `check_mmap`               | `sys_mmap`                               | W^X memory      |
| `check_mprotect`           | `sys_mprotect`                           | W^X memory      |
| `task_exit`                | `sys_exit_group`                         | state cleanup   |
| `init` / `set_time_source` | `zCore` boot (`primary_main`)            | bring-up        |

## Enforcement domains and modes

There are three independently-tunable enforcement domains, each with its own
`Mode` so the subsystem can be rolled out audit-first and tightened per-domain:

- **`Off`** — domain disabled (no checks, no logging).
- **`Report`** — log the violation but allow the action (audit / IDS mode).
- **`Enforce`** — log the violation and block the action.

| Domain    | What it governs                                   | Default   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `syscall` | Per-process syscall whitelists (lightweight seccomp) | `Enforce` |
| `wx`      | Write-xor-execute memory (`mmap` / `mprotect`)    | `Report`  |
| `exec`    | Executable path policy (untrusted/world-writable) | `Report`  |

The defaults are deliberately conservative. The syscall domain is `Enforce`
because whitelists are opt-in per process (no policy registered ⇒ permissive),
so it cannot break a process that didn't ask for filtering. The W^X and
exec-path domains default to `Report` because real dynamic linkers / JITs
transiently create `W+X` mappings and the base system legitimately execs from a
variety of paths — blocking by default would risk breaking userspace. Operators
opt into `Enforce` (`policy::set_wx_mode`, `policy::set_exec_mode`).

## Intrusion detection (heuristics)

Two signals are produced on the syscall hot path, *after* the policy check so
they only ever observe calls that were allowed to run:

1. **Sensitive-syscall watch** — constant-time classification of each syscall
   against a small table of security-relevant operations (kernel module
   loading, `ptrace`, `bpf`, credential changes, namespace escapes, `kexec`,
   cross-process writes, …). Matches are recorded as audit events; they are
   never blocked here. The table is the Linux x86_64 ABI.

2. **Rate anomalies** — cheap per-process sliding-window counters that flag
   syscall **floods** (possible DoS) and **fork bombs**. Each anomaly is
   reported at most once per window to avoid log storms. Toggle with
   `heuristics::set_anomaly_detection`.

## `/proc/hunter`

Reading `/proc/hunter` renders a live report: a status header (per-domain modes,
event counters, active syscall policies) followed by the recent event ring.
Example:

```
hunter security subsystem v0.2.0
enforcement: syscall=enforce wx=report exec=report
events: total=3 blocked=0 warnings=1 critical=0 dropped=0
active syscall policies: 0

recent events (oldest first):
[     0] +         0.000s pid=0     INFO   SYSTEM    INIT: hunter security subsystem v0.2.0 initialized (...)
[     1] +         4.512s pid=142   NOTICE PRIVILEGE WATCH: sensitive syscall #101 (ptrace)
[     2] +         5.001s pid=142   WARN   ANOMALY   WARNING: possible fork bomb: >200 clone/fork within 1000ms
```

## Programmatic configuration

```rust
use hunter::{policy, Mode};

// Restrict a process to a syscall whitelist (a lightweight seccomp).
policy::register_policy(pid, vec![/* allowed syscall numbers */]);

// Tighten W^X to active blocking.
policy::set_wx_mode(Mode::Enforce);

// Treat execution from world-writable paths as fatal.
policy::set_exec_mode(Mode::Enforce);
policy::add_untrusted_exec_prefix(String::from("/run/user/"));
```
