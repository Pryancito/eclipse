# DEPRECATED - Migrated to S6

This directory contains mini-systemd which has been **replaced by S6**.

## Migration Complete

Eclipse OS now uses the **S6 supervision suite** as its init system.

The mini init system is now part of the S6 implementation in:
- `eclipse-apps/s6/` - Main S6 implementation

## This Directory

This directory is kept for historical reference only and will be removed in a future release.

For the current init system, see:
- [eclipse-apps/s6/README.md](../../eclipse-apps/s6/README.md)
